What have I learnt doing IO?

1. I've been forcing myself to not jump to the documentation as much (as IO's is quite light) and google (as googling anything to do with IO is a pain - unless you want to just copy other people's answers from this book).

It's taught me to interrogate code more - IO's structure is so simple, so much so you have to remind yourself *don't over complicate this* that it lends itself to that.

It's taught me to think more carefully about a languages design and use that to influence my solutions - before IO I didn't think too heavily about what constraints were there but also what freedoms I was being deliberately given.

I've had to solve alot of things more myself, and read documentation more carefully. Often I'm prone to skimming documentation or rushing straight to stack overflow. Instead here I've had to interrogate the language and methods directly.


2. It's made me understand OO alot more

Before this, I had done Ruby, PhP and JS - but what I'd really done was Ruby, Ruby in JS and Ruby in PhP. For me, OO had to be implemented with classes and instances. The whole idea of prototypes makes alot more sense - and by extension what underlying implementatin of JS. Though we're moving away with ES6 to basically treating JS as a class-instance.


3. It's made appreciate how much you can learn in a short period of time

I've done this over 4 days, and gone from no IO understanding to reasonable levels. But more importantly, I know how  to build up more of an understanding.

I've also seen a language that focuses less on readability but on codeability. It's easy to write code in IO and to manipulate and control. It is harder to follow the code though. Ruby is much more successful in your ability to quickly follow and pick up. But you can easily work out how to solve a problem in IO.

4. Sped up my vim

I've doing all my work in vim for this - and it's pushed me to use things like buffers which I have avoided before.
My mouse also broke part way through, and this has been great for pushing me to actually use the hotkeys on my ubuntu - I've found I've got alot faster in the terminal as a result.


6. Learning - memorisaing definitions is good

Often people don't think learning definitions is useful - but actually alot of my learning has come from looking up words I don't know and then memorising definitions. From IO I've been forced to think about what recursion actually is, what is prototype languages as opposed to class based, what is a homosematic language.

7. Make me enjoy learning languages

Often learning languages has been stressful - pressured. But the writer of 7 languages also has an infectious enthusiam - it makes me want to delve more. Barriers are opportunities to learn - something I believe but don't always put into practise. It's made me appreciate more that disconnections, points of confusion are really useful in guiding you to a- see what you need to learn more  b- interesting points of comparison with other languages c - is there anything that the language could do better to make it more understandable?

8. There are very different ways of approaching very similar ideas

I'd never really appreciated until IO that you could do some pretty fundamental things in different ways. How do you approach booleans? How do you approach operations - especially adding syntactic sugar for them? IO goes, make them objects, make booleans singletons.

Doing IO has made me see that looking at these base level types, how they're appraoched. How if statements are implemented - teaches you alot about the philisophy of the language.


### Areas for development

I'm still unwilling to break away when I get stuck in a problem. I also don't think carefully enough about what
I also like to rush into code, often not fully thinking about how and why it works this way.

a) Meta questions - what questions *should* I be asking when faced with a problem
b) When working with code and languages - how do I deleve into it well -
c) Be willing to stop, change and come back to questions
d) Writing anki questions on the fly - at the moment I write notes then go through and write questions. This is much slower.
