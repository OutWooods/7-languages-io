## Knowledge vs Learning

Learning IO has been the first language I've learnt where I've set aside time to working on improving my recall and memory - and integrating that into my learning time. It's hard to motivate myself to do, as often you want to dive into a project quickly. But in the past, when I've learnt a new language or framework, I've found that a few weeks, months, even days later, my memory of my learning has dropped and I have to relearn the skill. So I wanted to combat this by trying to make my learning more long term and in built. 

So this project has been about combining my knowledge from my time as a teacher with my approach to learning programming languages. I wanted to see how I could improve my learning, but not make it too complex so that I wouldn't keep the habit up. 
So the main change is that each 'day' has an Anki deck for it - with facts that I have to practise and remember, alongside doing the challenges. I've not worried about typos, as this forces me to read them a bit harder - and it makes it easier to write them.

Anki is a great app that uses spaced repetition to improve your memory of a topic. It has a clever algorithm that increases and decreases the gap between when each card is shown to you, based on how good you are at it. This fits what quite alot of research says about maximising your memory.

## How does Memory Work?

Super basic, and over simplified - but essentially how well you remember something in the long term is a mixture of two things. Storage and retrieval strength.

Storage strength is how well your have it held in your long term memory.
Retrieval strength is how easily you can bring it back.

These arn't stable and you can have one without the other. So if you've just learnt a new phone number, you may be able to easily retrieve it now, but your storage strength may be weak. Childhood memories, may be stored well, but hard to retrieve (it might take going home, or looking at photos, to spark those memories.)

My choice of Anki is that it works well to tackle both - the flash cards it shows gives you are shown to you at increasing gaps (so 1 day, then 3 days then 7... as long as you get them right). This means that you're getting retrieval practise, to improve your retrieval strength, but at the same time, by increasing the gap you're making it more and more of a challenge each time - which helps improve your storage strength. It also means that cards you find easy quickly get repeated less often and ones you find hard, get repeated more often (as it decreases gaps for cards you get wrong). So it prioritises your weaknesses.

## So why does memorising facts make me a better coder?

Whilst obviously, coders shouldn't just remember facts - problem solving is significantly enhanced by base level knowledge. There are some schools of thought that say skills are just more complex mixtures of facts and knowledge. But we won't get into that right now.

Memorising basic syntax rules and facts about the language you are using have several benefits:

1) It primarily comes back to working (or short term) memory. You have a limit of how many things you can actively hold in your working memory (4-9 depending on what and different researchers). If you start trying to juggle too many things in your head it's called cognitive overload - you just feel overwhelmed and can barely see the wood for the trees.

When you start remembering facts and syntax - these are all things you don't need to hold in your working memory. So you can just focus on solving the problem.

2) A related point is memorising facts and syntax causes less context switching when you code. You have to rush to the docs less, so when you're solving a problem, you can discuss just the problem, and stay in your editor alot more. And even if you don't remeber some syntax perfectly, it becomes much quicker and easier to search for a concept. 

3) The more you know, the more approaches you can take. By knowing a wider range of syntax you have an idea what different options are out there. Good problem solving requires many approaches, so remembering the different aspects of a language may help you spot an alternative path more easily. 

4) Often when doing anki cards, I've found that the random changes of orders of cards has caused me to spot and connect different concepts. So for example, one time I had a card on concurrency in python followed by one in IO - and it made me think and draw comparissons between the two approaches. Or another time my cards on prologs declarative approach followed by IO's imperative helped me think more deeply about the advantages of each. 

5) Michaels Law - the more you know, the more easy it is for you to learn. There's lots to suggest once you know a bit about a topic, you can learn more stuff more quickly - because you have more things in your memory to connect a new idea to. So if you have good deep knowledge of one language, you can pick up new ones or new ideas more quickly as you have more things in your memory to connect these new ideas too.

## Did it work?

So, coming back a few weeks later to this. I've found by having to do flashcards daily, its much easier to delve into my IO code. Though the pace of learning was probably slower (I had to spend time memorising, and making cards when I could have been coding). The quality of my memory has improved. I know less, but I feel more confident with what I do know about IO.

One thing I would like to work on and improve, is to be better at identifying what are useful facts to memorise and what are not. I found quite a few of the syntax cards from day 1 not very useful now. And I was a bit prone to making too many cards (which decreased my motivation to revise - as it took more time, which meant less time to actually code.)

## How can I make my coding practise better?

This project has made me think alot about how I can decrease my cognitive load when I code, and enable me to focus on solving problems. These are some things I've noticed and will be trying to implement more myself:

1. You see this alot, coders often start getting very devoted to one setup and flow for their code - i.e. ides. This way they don't have to think about actually writing the code etc.

2. Memorising syntax - if you remember key syntactic rules, you don't have to worry about them when solving a problem. The amount of times when pairing we've had to go to the docs to double check basic syntax.  <- an arguement against this would be 'what about IDE's auto suggestions' and this is true. But you still have to remember something to utilise auto suggests most effectively.

3. Auto-format auto-format auto-format. Again more and more experience with a language, programmers like all experts see patterns rather than specifics. Auto formatting makes the structure of your code clear and patterns easier to spot - but also, removes the cognitive load of actually having to remember formatting rules. This is probably the quickest win you can make.

4. If you're struggling with a problem. Turn off your music (ideally the office is silent if not, finding ways to block noise is helpful.) Music is simply a distraction from the problem, especially if you have lyric based music. If you can't then some sort of white noise to block everything out.

5. If you're pairing, give yourself 5 minutes to interrogate and understand a problem alone. Again, having to explain and think things through (though useful) can be hard. Especially with early stage thoughts.

## Reflections on Anki

1. Set limits on how many you need to do a day. Start low. The process of recall is quite tiring quite quickly so its good to take breaks.

2. Rather than upload one at a time, you can write them throughout the day (I open a text file and jot them down as I go) and then upload them at the end.

3. Download it on your phone. Then you can do a few cards on your commute or whenever. I found walking around and doing a few quickly stacked up.

4. When recalling - be strict. Don't allow yourself 'almost there' attempts (we often over estimate how close we actually were - but also you'll be surprised how if you're pedantic it'll soon stick properly).

5. Work is very much heavy at the start but diminishes over time - because the spaces increase 50 cards today drops to 5 or six within a few days. 

6. If a card is hard and you keep failing. A - do you really understand it? B - develop a memory device C - Break the card down D - add bonus related facts

7. For code or anything add some 'fill in the blanks' to this too.

8. Ideally don't listen to music whilst doing your anki cards.
