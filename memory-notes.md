## Knowledge vs Learning

Working in progress

Learning IO has been the first language I've learnt, where I've been focusing on recall and memory. 
This first language I've been focusing alot on recall and memory. 
Each day has an Anki deck for it - with factual questions. 

Anki is a great app that uses spaced repetition to improve your memory of a topic. It has a clever algorithm that increases and decreases the gap between when each card is shown to you, based on how good you are at it, and what will maximise your ability to remeber it.


## What is your memory?

Super basic - but essentially how well you remember something is a mixture of two things. Storage and retrieval strength.

Storage is how well your have it held in your long term memory. 
Retrieval is how easily you can bring it back. 

These arn't stable, you retrieval strength can degrate, in one room you may have better retrieval strength for some topics than others (e.g. childhood memories when you visit your family home). Anki by spreading out the topics over time is improving your storage and retrieval strength. The practise over time is improving the storage, and focing you to recall it each time makes sure your retrieval strength is better. 

## So why does memorising facts make me a better coder?

a) Often the focus is on 'being good problem solvers' and so there can be an emphasis on language agnosticsm
b) This leads people to discount the importance of syntax and knowledge of code
c) Coding courses focus on projects, rarely on retention and memory of facts and skills

Whilst obviously, coders shouldn't just remember facts - problem solving is significantly enhanced by base level knowledge. There are some schools of thought that say skills are just more complex mixtures of facts and knowledge. But we won't get into that right now.

Memorising basic syntax rules and facts about the language you are using have several benefitS.  

It primarily comes back to working memory. You have a limit of how many things you can actively hold in your working memory (4-9 depending on what and different researchers). 

When you start remembering facts and syntax - these are all things you don't need to hold in your working memory. So you can just focus on solving the problem. If you face something challenging.

## How it should inform my work?

1. You see this alot, coders often start getting very devoted to one setup and flow for their code - i.e. ides. This way they don't have to think about actually writing the code etc.
2. Memorising syntax - if you remember key syntactic rules, you don't have to worry about them when solving a problem. The amount of times when pairing we've had to go to the docs to double check basic syntax.  <- an arguement against this would be 'what about IDE's auto suggestions' and this is true. But you still have to remember something to utilise auto suggests most effectively.
3. Auto-format auto-format auto-format. Again more and more experience with a language, programmers like all experts see patterns rather than specifics. Auto formatting makes the structure of your code clear and patterns easier to spot - but also, removes the cognitive load of actually having to remember formatting rules. This is probably the quickest win you can make.
4. If you're struggling with a problem. Turn off your music (ideally the office is silent if not, finding ways to block noise is helpful.) Music is simply a distraction from the problem, especially if you have lyric based music. If you can't then some sort of white noise to block everything out.
5. If you're pairing, give yourself 5 minutes to interrogate and understand a problem alone. Again, having to explain and think things through (though useful) can be hard. Especially with early stage thoughts.

For anything you need to memorise. One of the simplest and easiest ways to achieve this - is Anki. 
The key is whatever you do - active recall (aka you actually have to remember it rather than passively read or watch.)

Anki repeats cards and separates them out over time. 

## Tips on Anki

1. Look at this reddit article on how to format questions (good questions are surprisingly key).
2. Set limits on how many you need to do a day. Start low. The process of recall is quite tiring quite quickly so its good to take breaks.
3. Rather than upload one at a time, you can write them throughout the day (like I do) and then upload them at the end.
4. Adding say 50 cards may feel like alot
5. Download it on your phone. Then you can do a few cards on your commute or whenever. 
6. When recalling - be strict. Don't allow yourself 'almost there' attempts (we often over estimate how close we actually were - but also you'll be surprised how if you're pedantic it'll soon stick properly).
7. Work is very much heavy at the start but diminishes over time - the first and second time is often the hardest
8. If a card is hard and you keep failing. A - do you really understand it? B - develop a memory device C - Break the card down D - add bonus related facts
9. For code or anything add some 'fill in the blanks' to this too. 
10. Ideally don't listen to music whilst doing your anki cards.
